Update before you stop. Newest entry on top.

## Status
- Completed: Modules 0-2 (see PLAN.md; one box needs the user)
- In flight: none
- Next command: `git push origin main` after GitHub re-auth
- Blockers: `git push` fails, GitHub token for Boss720 expired; re-auth needed

## From Claude
- 2026-10-25: Codex wrote its own lookalike "done (...)" status mid-run; closed the hole (done refused for headless tasks, wait checks the runner pid). Suite now 12 cases, runs as the merge gate.
- 2026-10-25: All three harnesses now run the same way: `dispatch codex|antigravity` = headless worker in its own worktree, runner commits, board status, `wait`, `merge` (Codex review gate + Test command), `cancel`. Antigravity uses the `agy` CLI with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (user's choice); task rules confine it to its worktree. Proven live in MetaStrip: Antigravity wrote `test/ui-hint.test.js`, merged through the gate, 24 tests pass there; the test fails correctly when a format is dropped from the UI hint.
- 2026-10-25: Split MetaStrip into its own repo at `D:\AI\projects\Dev\Projects\MetaStrip`; it uses this toolkit through `trinity init`. This repo is the toolkit only.
- 2026-10-25: Repo scaffolded. Codex reachable via `scripts\codex-*.cmd`.
